# The ShoppyGlobe E-commerce Backend

The ShoppyGlobe E-commerce Backend is a RESTful API system built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It powers the backend operations of an e-commerce platform, offering features like product listing, cart management, user registration, and secure login. Designed for scalability and simplicity, this API provides developers with clean endpoints, robust validation, and MongoDB integration using Mongoose. This project showcases how a modern backend system can handle business logic, database communication, and user sessions for an online shopping platform.

Product Management Users or administrators can retrieve all products or view a specific product by its ID. Each product includes attributes such as title, description, price, and quantity. These APIs allow the front end to dynamically display available items and detailed product views. Products are fetched directly from a MongoDB database using Mongoose ORM, ensuring fast and secure data handling.
GET /products: Fetch all products.

Cart Functionality The cart system allows users to manage products they intend to purchase. Users can add products to the cart, update the quantity, or remove items entirely. The logic ensures that the quantity being added or updated never exceeds the available stock, thus maintaining inventory integrity.
POST /cart: Adds a product to the cart or updates quantity if it already exists.

PUT /cart: Directly updates the quantity of a product in the cart.

DELETE /cart: Removes a product from the cart using productId.

Each cart operation includes error handling to account for invalid product IDs, out-of-stock items, or missing data.

User Registration and Authentication The backend provides secure user registration and login functionality. New users can register by providing their name, email, and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database, enhancing security. During login, user credentials are verified, and a JWT token is generated for session handling.
POST /register: Registers a new user after checking for existing accounts.

POST /login: Logs in a user and returns a JWT token if authentication succeeds.

JWT tokens can be used to protect future routes like orders, profiles, or admin panels.

Error Handling & Middleware The project uses middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and error management. All API responses are structured with clear messages and status codes, making them easy to consume on the frontend or in debugging tools like Postman.
